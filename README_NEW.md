## Hosting Your Portfolio Website

To make your portfolio website accessible to others, you can host it using one of the following methods:

### 1. GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your `portfolio.html` file to the repository.
3. Go to the repository settings and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`) and click "Save".
5. Your portfolio will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/portfolio.html`.

### 2. Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Drag and drop your `portfolio.html` file into the Netlify interface.
3. Netlify will provide you with a link to your hosted portfolio.

Once hosted, you can share the link with others to showcase your portfolio!
